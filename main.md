## Numerical simulations - Configuration
We performed 70-member ensemble simulations of SO2 transport using the FALL3D model. Different source term parameters were perturbed.

| Parameter | Reference | Perturbation range |
| --------  | -------- | -------- |
| Suzuki-A  | 4     | 3           |
| Suzuki-Î»  | 2     | 1.5         |
| Wind componentes | CARRA | 20%  |
| Column height | Measurements (see plot below) | 20% |
| Emission rate | Fixed (100 kg/s) | No perturbed |

### Meteorological dataset
Carra reanalysis at 2.5-km resolution on pressure levels. Use model levels in the future!

### Vertical distribution
We explored different vertical distributions:
