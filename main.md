## Observations
We considered measurements of SO2 concentration at 4 ground stations with a radius of about 50 km between 11-Aug-2021 and 17-Aug-2021.

Concentration timeseries show a diurnal variation pattern?

Forecasts for the Boundary layer thickness show maximum heights around 15:00

## Numerical simulations - Configuration
We performed 70-member ensemble simulations of SO2 transport using the FALL3D model. Different source term parameters were perturbed.

| Parameter | Reference | Perturbation range |
| --------  | -------- | -------- |
| Suzuki-A  | 4     | 3           |
| Suzuki-Î»  | 2     | 1.5         |
| Wind componentes | IFS on model levels | 20%  |
| Column height | See figure below | 20% |
| Emission rate | Fixed (100 kg/s) | No perturbed |


### Meteorological dataset
Operational forecasts are produced with the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) with a horizontal resolution of 9 km using 137 layers in the vertical.

### Vertical distribution
We explored different vertical distributions:

### Column height
We performed to ensemble simulations. In experiment A, the source term is
defined from a timeseries of column height estimations. In experiment B,
a fixed column height is assumed (1500 m above the vent).

## Results: Best ensemble member
The linear correlation between every member and the observations was computed
and the best ensemble member was selected:

### Experiment A
![](figs/bestA.png)

Precision = TP/(TP+FP) = 25%

### Experiment B
![](figs/bestB.png)

Precision = TP/(TP+FP) = 27%

## Results: Vertical mixing
